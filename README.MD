# 🖥️ ApmCounter

ApmCounter is a minimalist, intuitive macOS app that accurately tracks your **Actions Per Minute (APM)**. Perfect for productivity enthusiasts, developers, gamers, or anyone interested in analyzing their activity patterns.


## 🤔 Why ApmCounter?

                                                                                                                        I built ApmCounter because I wanted a simple, lightweight app to track my Actions Per Minute (APM) on macOS. After searching online, I found many requests from users looking for a macOS-friendly APM tracker, but nearly all existing solutions were Windows-only.
